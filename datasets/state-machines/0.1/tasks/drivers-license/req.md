# Driver's license — requirements

Design a state machine for a driver’s license lifecycle:

- An applicant applies.
- The applicant passes a knowledge test.
- The applicant passes a road test.
- After passing both, the system issues a license.
- A license can be suspended.
- A suspended license can be reinstated.

Constraints:
- Road test cannot be passed before the knowledge test.
- A license cannot be issued before both tests are passed.
