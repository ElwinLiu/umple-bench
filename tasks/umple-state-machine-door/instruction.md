# Generate Umple state machine

Create `/app/door.ump` using Umple syntax.

## Requirements

- Define a class called `Door` with a state machine attribute named `sm`.
- The door starts in the Closed state.
- Opening the door transitions from Closed to Open. Closing it transitions back to Closed.
- Locking the door transitions from Closed to Locked. Unlocking it transitions back to Closed.

Do not create any other classes or files. The only output should be `/app/door.ump`.
